Thinking about hiring me? Let's see if I'm a good fit for your project.

I have three backgrounds. First, I've been programming since I was 10. In the
last years I've been working as a lead developer in different web startups, focusing
mainly on backend and devops. Here's a list of things I was mostly working on:

* Designing and implementing the backend cache; optimizing single endpoints.
* Implementing REST APIs.
* Implementing microservices.
* Creating server-side functions for PostgreSQL, making certain app aspects more effective.
* Creating C-based Ruby gems (like [this](https://github.com/be9/imagecore)).
* Refactoring existing code to make it more modular, easier to understand and reason about.
* Curating upgrades (Rails 3 to Rails 4, RSpec 2 to 3, etc.)
* Implementing monitoring solutions ([Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/),
[StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd), [grafana](http://grafana.org/), and custom monitoring apps).
* Provisioning AWS servers with [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
* Developing tools which greatly simplify the life of other developers (like
[my deploy system]({% post_url 2015-12-01-heroku-deployment %})).
* Solving really hard problems like [this memory leak]({% post_url 2015-09-21-memory-leak %}).
* Finally, just implementing features :)

My second background is science. Back in 2011 I got a PhD from Institute
of Automation and Electrometry (Novosibirsk, Russia). I worked in two fields:
signal processing and machine learning. As such:

* Knowledge of machine learning techniques allowed me to implement an efficient spam/ham classifier microservice for one of the projects.
* The scientific method was crucial in finding the [memory leak]({% post_url 2015-09-21-memory-leak %}).
It was all about making and verifying hypotheses in a systematic manner.

The third background is teaching. I've been working with first- and second-year
students in my [alma mater](http://www.nsu.ru/) since 2002. Currently I teach
a C++-based OOP course. My teaching experience makes me never freak out when
seeing bad code, but rather find and suggest ways to improve it. Therefore
I often act as a mentor, giving advice to my colleagues; they find it valuable.

The startups I worked with mostly used Rails, but not exclusively. Apart from
using plain Ruby, I've used Clojure to implement some internal apps and services.
I'm very fond of this language and plan to use it further – with [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
and [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/), where possible. I'm also a C++ expert, but that's another story.
