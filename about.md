Hi, I'm Oleg Dashevskii, a developer based in Siberia (Russia). I graduated from
[Novosibirsk State University][nsu].

Over the last few years I've been working on Ruby on Rails backends in various
startups: APIs, caching, optimization, etc.

I also have a scientific background (PhD included!). My primary interest in this
field is Machine Learning: complex-valued neural networks and more mundane things.

Last, but not the least, I teach Object Oriented Programming course in my alma
mater.

Basically I've been programming since I was 10, and it's still fun! Latest tech
which ignites me is Clojure and Rust.

Find me on [Github][github] / [Twitter][Twitter] or drop a line to
[be9@be9.ru](be9@be9.ru).
