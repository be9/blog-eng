Hi, I'm Oleg Dashevskii, a developer based in Siberia (Russia). I graduated from
[Novosibirsk State University][nsu].

Over the last few years I've been working on Ruby on Rails backends in various
startups. {% if false %}Currently I'm employed by [Shuttlerock][shuttlerock].{% endif %}

I also have a scientific background (PhD included!). My primary interest in this
field is Machine Learning: complex-valued neural networks and more mundane things.

Last, but not the least, I teach Object Oriented Programming course in my [alma
mater][nsu].

Basically I've been programming since I was 10, and it's still fun! Apart from
Ruby and Rails I use C++ for my OOP course and scientific work, Clojure for
selected projects, and am willing to try Rust.

Find me on [Github][github] / [Twitter][Twitter] or drop a line to
[be9@be9.ru](be9@be9.ru).
